# This function takes the data matrix trainX and the corresponding labels 
# as input parameter and returns the corresponding parameters needed for Na√Øve Bayes'.

# For each class, a probability vector is needed.  So P(x|C=0) and 
# P(x|C=1) can be stored in the variables  probVecClass0 and probVecClass1
# For example for three binary features, P(x=[1 1 1]T|C=1) would be a vector of 
# probabilities [3/7 4/7 4/7] T.  Note this is P(x1=1|C=1), P(x2=1|C=1) and P(x3=1|C=1)
# Similarly compute P(x|C=0) and priors for both classes

function [probVecClass0 probVecClass1 prior0 prior1]  = learnProb (trainX,trainLabels)

# Calculating prior probability of Class 0 with smoothing
  prior0 = (sum(trainLabels == 0)+1)/(size(trainLabels)(1)+2);

# Calculating prior probability of Class 1 with smoothing
  prior1 = (sum(trainLabels == 1)+1)/(size(trainLabels)(1)+2);

# Calculating probability vectors for Class 0 and 1 considering MAP

# Calculating X/C with smoothing
